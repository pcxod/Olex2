p4p_automate [False] - specifies if the SG/SGE to be executed after loading the P4P/CRS file (used in reap)
aromatic_rings [False] - specifies if the aromatic rings are to be automatically created
aromatic_rings_def [C5,C6,NC5,SC4,N2C3,NCNC2] - aromatic ring definitions
mouse_invert_zoom [False] - specifies if the mouse zooming operation to be inverted
mouse_click_threshold [2] - specifiec the rectangluar area size where the mouse click is recognised
hbond_min_angle [120] - the minimal angle fo H-bonds to exist
preserve_invalid_ins [false] - if invalid instructios are preserved vs being deleted
q_peak_min_alpha [0] - minimum value for the Q-peak transparence (0-0.75)
tooltip_occu_chem [True] - tooltip shows chemical occupancy vs crystallographic one
gl_selection [True] - to use the OpenGl selection implementation. If False - a more limited
 but working more precise with some drivers implementation is used. It however does not allow
 the selection of objets which use textures (unless treated specifically) or colours..
gl_multisample [True] - enables smoothing of the rendering, though reduces the prformace it
 produces better quality picture
gl_stereo [True] - enables stereo buffers. Note that if this option is enabled and your graphics
 card does not support stereo buffers, gl_multisample option will be turmed off be default at
 first Olex2 run. However, on exit, Olex2 will check this and will disable this option so that
 multisampling will work
preserve_restraint_defaults [false] - if set, the default restraint values/weights are shown in
 the ins file. This option has no effect when DEFS instruction is set.
preserve_fvars - preserves the even if they are refered only once
safe_afix [True] - checks AFIXes are correct after atom naming, deleting and HAdd itself
confirm_on_close [False] - asks a confirmation question before closing the application
profile [False] - switches application profiling on/off
interactions_from [H] - sets a list of atoms for which to display short contacts
interactions_to [N,O,F,Cl,S,Br,Se] - sets a list of atoms for which to display short contacts
absolute_hkl_path [false] - saves absolute path in the INS file
group_restraints [false] - groups restraints by involved atoms
use_hkl_cell [true] - if HKL file has CELL instruction - Olex2 overrdes current file CELL with the
  parameters
path [] - extensions to the system PATH (prepended)
max_label_length [4] - new Shelxl will support longer labels in the INS file
locale.ctype [] - default locale. Yo may need to use en_US.utf8 for Linux/Mac
cif.use_md5 [false] - embedd MD5 checksums for HKL/FAB/RES into the CIF
rename_parts [true] - disallow identical labels within different parts
model.center_on_reload [true] - re-centres the model on the file re-read (like after the refinement)
model.center_on_update [true] - re-centres the model when it is updated (like atoms split)
moiety.check_connectivity [false] - checks if moiety entities grow when reporting
