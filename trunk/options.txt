p4p_automate [False] - specifies if the SG/SGE to be executed after loading the P4P/CRS file (used in reap)
aromatic_rings [False] - specifies if the aromatic rings are to be automatically created
aromatic_rings_def [C5,C6,NC5,SC4,N2C3,NCNC2] - aromatic ring definitions
mouse_invert_zoom [False] - specifies if the mouse zooming operation to be inverted
mouse_click_threshold [2] - specifiec the rectangluar area size where the mouse click is recognised
hbond_min_angle [120] - the minimal angle fo H-bonds to exist
preserve_invalid_ins [false] - if invalid instructios are preserved vs being deleted
q_peak_min_alpha [0] - minimum value for the Q-peak transparence (0-0.75)
tooltip_occu_chem [True] - tooltip shows chemical occupancy vs crystallographic one
gl_selection [True] - to use the OpenGl selection implementation. If False - a more limited
 but working more precise with some drivers implementation is used. It however does not allow
 the selection of objets which use textures (unless treated specifically) or colours..

 produces better quality picture
gl_stereo [True] - enables stereo buffers. Note that if this option is enabled and your graphics
 card does not support stereo buffers, gl_multisample option will be turmed off be default at
 first Olex2 run. However, on exit, Olex2 will check this and will disable this option so that
 multisampling will work
preserve_restraint_defaults [false] - if set, the default restraint values/weights are shown in
 the ins file. This option has no effect when DEFS instruction is set.
preserve_fvars - preserves the even if they are refered only once

profile [False] - switches application profiling on/off
interactions_from [H] - sets a list of atoms for which to display short contacts
interactions_to [N,O,F,Cl,S,Br,Se] - sets a list of atoms for which to display short contacts
